===================

Racket game project made in CSCI 1301 by Shawn &amp; Zach

This game was voted by the class as the best game out of the seventeen submitted.
We spent about 20 hours on this game. It was our first real attempt at making a completed application!

Thanks for checking out our game and if you want to see other projects we are working on look at our profile!

There are executable versions of the game inside! Feel free to pull them out and play the game!
